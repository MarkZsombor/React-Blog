# Blogtastic

A blog site step up using React and Redux for the purpose of getting more experience using Redux for handling application state. Site shows by default a list of blog posts, and through the use of react-router can then move to individual blog posts. New blog posts can be made, and old ones updated or destroyed.

The site uses a MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) and utilized redux for state management. User authorization is  handled by PassportJS using Google OAuth. Styling was achieved using the Materialize CSS framework.

The site is deployed on heroku at [blogtasticmz.herokuapp.com](https://blogtasticmz.herokuapp.com/).

TODO: Fix the auto-populate update forms. Add comments to posts.
